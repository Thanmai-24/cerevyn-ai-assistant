# ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Guide for Cerevyn AI Assistant

## âœ… Pre-Deployment Checklist

Your project is **100% ready** for Railway deployment! All necessary files are in place:

- âœ… `Procfile` - Tells Railway how to start your app
- âœ… `runtime.txt` - Specifies Python 3.11.0
- âœ… `requirements.txt` - All dependencies including gunicorn
- âœ… `rag_server.py` - Updated for Railway (uses PORT env var)
- âœ… `.gitignore` - Proper exclusions for deployment

## ðŸŽ¯ Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Commit and Push Your Code
```bash
# Add all files
git add .

# Commit with deployment message
git commit -m "Add Railway deployment configuration for Cerevyn AI Assistant"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy on Railway

1. **Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)**
2. **Sign in** with your GitHub account
3. **Click "New Project"**
4. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
5. **Choose your repository**: `Thanmai-24/cerevyn-ai-assistant`
6. **Click "Deploy Now"**

### Step 3: Railway Auto-Detection

Railway will automatically detect:
- âœ… **Python Application** - From `requirements.txt`
- âœ… **Start Command** - From `Procfile`
- âœ… **Python Version** - From `runtime.txt`
- âœ… **Dependencies** - Will install all packages

### Step 4: Environment Configuration (Optional)

In Railway dashboard, you can set environment variables:
- `FLASK_ENV=production` (recommended)
- `PORT` (automatically set by Railway)

### Step 5: Access Your Deployed App

Railway will provide a URL like:
- `https://cerevyn-ai-assistant-production.up.railway.app`

## ðŸ”§ What Happens During Deployment

1. **Build Phase**:
   - Installs Python 3.11.0
   - Installs all dependencies from `requirements.txt`
   - Downloads ChromaDB and sentence-transformers models

2. **Start Phase**:
   - Runs `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT rag_server:app`
   - Your Flask app starts on Railway's assigned port
   - ChromaDB initializes in `./chroma_db`

3. **Health Check**:
   - Railway monitors `/health` endpoint
   - App becomes available at your Railway URL

## ðŸŒŸ Features Available After Deployment

### âœ… **Web Interface**
- Modern ChatGPT-like UI
- Speech-to-text in English/Hindi
- File upload support
- Real-time chat

### âœ… **API Endpoints**
- `POST /add_text` - Add text knowledge
- `POST /add_file` - Upload files (PDF, DOCX, CSV, etc.)
- `POST /search` - Search knowledge base
- `POST /get_context` - Get context for queries
- `GET /health` - Health check

### âœ… **Supported File Types**
- PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, JSON, XLSX
- Automatic text extraction
- Vector embeddings for semantic search

### âœ… **Multilingual Support**
- English and Hindi language detection
- Automatic response language matching

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails:

1. **Check Build Logs**:
   - Look for dependency installation errors
   - Verify Python version compatibility

2. **Common Issues**:
   - **Memory**: ChromaDB + sentence-transformers need ~1GB RAM
   - **Timeout**: Large model downloads might timeout
   - **Port**: Ensure app binds to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`

3. **Solutions**:
   - Upgrade Railway plan if memory issues
   - Check `Procfile` syntax
   - Verify all dependencies in `requirements.txt`

### If App Starts But Doesn't Work:

1. **Check Logs**:
   - Railway provides real-time logs
   - Look for Flask startup messages

2. **Test Endpoints**:
   - Visit `/health` endpoint
   - Check if ChromaDB initializes properly

## ðŸ“Š Expected Performance

- **Startup Time**: 30-60 seconds (model downloads)
- **Memory Usage**: ~1-2GB (ChromaDB + models)
- **Response Time**: <1 second for most queries
- **File Upload**: Supports files up to Railway limits

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Indicators

Your deployment is successful when:
- âœ… Railway shows "Deployed" status
- âœ… Health endpoint returns `{"status": "healthy"}`
- âœ… Web interface loads at your Railway URL
- âœ… File upload works
- âœ… Chat functionality responds

## ðŸ”„ Updates and Maintenance

To update your deployed app:
1. Make changes locally
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. Railway automatically redeploys
4. Your ChromaDB data persists between deployments
